# Production deployment

Production is [sweetpickledpineapple.com](https://sweetpickledpineapple.com), hosted by the Cloudflare Pages project `pineapple-siege-git`. Its Pages hostname is [pineapple-siege-git.pages.dev](https://pineapple-siege-git.pages.dev). GitHub's private `bn-bx/pineapple-siege` repository is the source; pushes to `main` trigger production builds.

## Build and release

Cloudflare uses Node 22, `npm run build`, repository root, and output directory `dist`. The build generates terrain parts, hashes audio, checks TypeScript, builds Vite, and verifies runtime assets. There are no Pages Functions or runtime secrets. `public/_headers` makes hashed assets immutable and HTML/world manifests revalidate.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push origin main
```

The checkout's local Git SSH configuration selects a repository-scoped write deploy key. Use your own authorized GitHub access on another machine; credentials belong outside the repository. Cloudflare's GitHub App connection is independent of local SSH access.

A push confirms GitHub receipt. Verify the new release on the production domain after Pages finishes building: `/release.json` must contain the intended release, the game must reach Ready and start, and `/world.json` plus every listed terrain part must return successfully. The Pages dashboard exposes build status and logs.

## Saves and recovery

Browser saves are scoped to the site origin. Keep the production domain unchanged to preserve players' IndexedDB progress; Pages preview URLs and localhost use separate storage. Do not include generated world files, `dist`, credentials, or local Cloudflare state in Git.

A failed build leaves the last successful production deployment live. Fix the build and push a new commit. For a bad release, roll back through Cloudflare Pages or revert the commit and push; then verify the domain. A dashboard rollback does not change Git history.

## Current release

`directional-nuke-flash-2026-10-09` restores stronger nuke flash brightness when facing the blast and a dimmer global flash when looking away, without distance attenuation. Valley flashes still last two seconds and follow only the explicit Reduce effects checkbox. Ultra-first Auto quality, eight pineapple clouds, and the 500 m excavation floor remain active. World version 8, save compatibility 9, and preference revision 5 remain unchanged.
