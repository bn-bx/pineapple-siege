# Production deployment

Production is [sweetpickledpineapple.com](https://sweetpickledpineapple.com), hosted by the Cloudflare Pages project `pineapple-siege-git`. Its Pages hostname is [pineapple-siege-git.pages.dev](https://pineapple-siege-git.pages.dev). GitHub's private `bn-bx/pineapple-siege` repository is the source; pushes to `main` trigger production builds.

## Build and release

Cloudflare uses Node 22, `npm run build`, repository root, and output directory `dist`. The build generates terrain parts, hashes audio, checks TypeScript, builds Vite, and verifies runtime assets. There are no Pages Functions or runtime secrets. `public/_headers` makes hashed assets immutable and HTML/world manifests revalidate.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push origin main
```

The checkout's local Git SSH configuration selects a repository-scoped write deploy key. Use your own authorized GitHub access on another machine; credentials belong outside the repository. Cloudflare's GitHub App connection is independent of local SSH access.

A push confirms GitHub receipt. Verify the new release on the production domain after Pages finishes building: `/release.json` must contain the intended release, the game must reach Ready and start, and `/world.json` plus every listed terrain part must return successfully. The Pages dashboard exposes build status and logs.

## Saves and recovery

Browser saves are scoped to the site origin. Keep the production domain unchanged to preserve players' IndexedDB progress; Pages preview URLs and localhost use separate storage. Do not include generated world files, `dist`, credentials, or local Cloudflare state in Git.

A failed build leaves the last successful production deployment live. Fix the build and push a new commit. For a bad release, roll back through Cloudflare Pages or revert the commit and push; then verify the domain. A dashboard rollback does not change Git history.

## Current release

`steel-ball-2026-10-13` adds the fourth weapon: 120 m steel balls that inherit aircraft momentum, crush structures and actors, roll downhill, and leave shallow terrain dents and tracks. Drops replace the oldest ball at the 20-ball cap. Slow balls fade below 10 m/s; terrain edits and destruction persist in saves. Adaptive terrain colliders reduce ball physics cost while retaining detailed collision geometry for sharp features. Nuclear ground flames have triple their original visual size and sprite density. World version 8, save compatibility 9, and preference revision 5 remain unchanged.
